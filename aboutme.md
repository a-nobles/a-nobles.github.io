<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>
Currently I am a <strong>data scientist</strong> and <strong>assistant professor</strong> in the Department of Medicine at UC San Diego. Preiously I was a civil engineer at CH2M before transitioning into <strong>systems and information engineering</strong> for <strong>public health</strong>. 
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
I obtained my PhD in <strong>Systems & Information Engineering</strong>, MS in Civil Engineering from the University of Virginia, and BS in Civil Engineering from Georgia Tech. My PhD applied methods from <strong>data science</strong> and <strong>human-computer interaction</strong> to examine online information seeking for <strong>sensitive, stigmatized</strong> reprodutive and sexual <strong>health issues</strong>. My postdoctoral fellowship further cross-trained me in <strong>public health</strong>.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
I <strong>develop & apply tools</strong> to a variety of <strong>digital data</strong> sources (social media, text messages, search engine queries) to <strong>monitor human behavior</strong> (as manifested in our online digital footprints) and provide data-driven insights to inform <strong>health communication and interventions</strong>.

I love being outside and can often be found soaking up the sunshine in beautiful SoCal. I used to be an avid rock climber, but find hikes are more my speed now. I'm currently learning <strong>Spanish</strong> (I take conversational classes at Pura Buena Onda) and can now have short conversations!
