# Helpful Resources for Self-Learning Python

Several people who are new to Python have asked me what I've used to self-learn Python. I've used many, many resources while self-learning Python and data science. Below is a collection of some of my favorite resources that I've found helpful during my journey. This list is not exhaustive and I'll try to keep it updated as I continue to grow. 


**Introductory Resources:**

- [Udemy: Complete Python Bootcamp by Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/lecture/9478416#overview)
     - A good introduction to Python syntax. Discusses options for setting up Python and the difference between Python 2 and 3.
- [Book/Website: Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/)
     - A classic that I still refer back to for things like how to create a virtual enviornment.  
- [Udemy: Python for Data Science & Machine Learning by Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/5733430#overview)
     - Introduces the pandas and sklearn libraries. Pandas is very similar to R in that you can operate using dataframes.


**Intermediate Resources:**
These courses dig deeper into the why and how so you can better understand what is actually going on behind the scenes. In other words how to not fall into pitholes.

- [Udemy: Python Deep Dive Part 1 by Fred Baptiste](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-deep-dive-part-1/learn/lecture/7736814#overview)
- [Udemy: Python Deep Dive Part 2 by Fred Baptiste](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-deep-dive-part-2/learn/lecture/10059290#overview)
- [Udemy: Python Deep Dive Part 3 by Fred Baptiste](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-deep-dive-part-3/learn/lecture/11601094#overview)
- [Udemy: Python Deep Dive Part 4 by Fred Baptiste](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-deep-dive-part-4/)

**Other Reources:**

- **Stack Overflow** is your friend. When you are stuck, use Stack Overflow to find solutions. This is difficult at first until you learn the right terms to search for. I remember searching and it taking hours just because I didn't know a keyword. You learn with more practice - don't give up!

- If you've never had any programming classes so for loops, if statements, etc sound foreign, then I may recommend an introductory course on programming from Coursera, Udacity, or the like. But if you're familiar with these concepts and just want to code in Python, then the above resources are the ones I've found helpful.

- **You need an interesting project!** Finding data can be difficult. One place to start is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (try out a problem or look at other people's solutions). Side note: numbers are initially easier to play with than text, which can be such a pain to learn with because of unicode errors, etc. 

- Meetup groups, like those on meetup.com, are a great place to meet other folks who are also learning or even more seasoned coders. Most large city have meetup groups for Python, data science, and women in tech.
